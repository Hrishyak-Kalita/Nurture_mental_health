Really? Out of all the design and coding principles in the design and UX and software strategies, the only thing software engineers want is to always use the KISS principle, with a bit of dramatic addition of the principle’s name.
<br/>
<br/>
But what is the KISS Principle, and why is it so important when it comes to developing and designing web and mobile applications?
<br/>
<br/>
KISS stands for “keep it simple, stupid.” It is a design principle that states that designs and/or systems should be as simple as feasible. Complexity should be avoided whenever possible in a system, as simplicity ensures the highest degree of user acceptability and interaction. Interface design, product design, and software development are just a few of the fields where KISS is employed.

<br/>
The KISS concept is also known by other names that have the same meaning. “Keep things short and simple” and “Keep it simple and straightforward” are two examples. Despite the fact that both expressions add an “A” to the acronym, they both convey the same message: “Keep things simple, dumb.” The goal of any procedure is to produce the simplest, most feasible result. As a result, the KISS concept encourages novice users to trust their instincts while gradually introducing complexities.

# Why KISS principle in programming, though?

Working on an existing code base is a huge issue for developers. When the KISS concept is used, however, that problem is solved. When consistency is required, the KISS principle makes it easier for others to grasp the process. Automated testing can be more efficient with simpler processes. A simple system is easier to test than a complex one.
By steering away from what clients need and want, regulations, software layers, work-flows, and even iconography that are incompatible with earning customer confidence can be simplified and removed.

## How to make your code solutions KISS-friendly?
So how can you become better at writing KISS code?

First of all, research! There are resources and e-books to help and guide you to mastering the KISS principle in your code, so put them into practice.

Here are a few tips to make use of the principle in your code:
1. **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate things. Break down complex problems into smaller
2. **Avoid unnecessary complexity**: Don't add features or functionality that aren't needed.
3. **Code for readability**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
4. **Use design patterns**: Use established design patterns to solve common problems.
